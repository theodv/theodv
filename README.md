## [Problem Statement:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTfJJ3WvJn04rxlFrvaZdeOyVKtWk8tQ8swejg1_l5XuhbF1HQ_B2d1L9yu9GQQf6yx_e9HiIx2qPVU/pub)
UofSC Students are frustrated because they don't know which dining hall to eat due to the lack of a campus-wide menu as well as the lack of accurate wait times for restaurants. Users also struggle with finding a dining hall that can accomodate their dietary restrictions. Our solution should provide users with a way to find dining halls/restaurants that offer food that accommodates their needs as well as accurate wait times.
