*I am currently learning how to code at the University of South Carolina and I am really excited!*
<!--

Here are some ideas to get you started:


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of coding.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects outside of class that will give me more experience and confidence in coding.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about lobsters.
